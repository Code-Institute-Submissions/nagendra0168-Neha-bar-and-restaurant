idea to create website for restaurant.This website mainly describes about the menu of the restaurant so the customer

## Technologies Used

- HTML - I used this to build the entire site and each individual page.

- CSS - This was used to style the html code.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) Bootstrap was used to make the site responsive on 
all devices  and the main structure of the site.

## Testing

The HTML code was put through the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check for syntax errors. Similarly, 
the CSS code was put through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

All the following testing has been carried out on smaller screens running both iOS and Android and on larger screens 
running both macOS and Windows in multiple browsers. In addition, Chrome's developer tools were used extensively to
test on all screen sizes including medium size which I did not otherwise have access to.

I also given close attention to the following scetions:

- Navigation bar

- images

- menu

Tested to open the pages on all sizes available in Chrome, Firefox, but not Edge, as it only had Slider available.

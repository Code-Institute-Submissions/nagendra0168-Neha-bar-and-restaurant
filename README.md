# Milestone Project one - Neha Bar And Restaurant

This is my first website which describes about the Neha Bar and Restaurant . Iam working as a chef now so i got an
idea to create website for restaurant.This website mainly describes about the menu of the restaurant so the customer
 can read  about the restaurant and about the menu . This website has dinner menu,lunch menu,booking a table and contact
 sections. As a chef i know the menus so i wrote everything my self but i have written everything in swedish language.

The deployed website can be found here

## UX

As a designer of this website, i can say this website has full information  to the customer.The customer can find
lunch menu from monday to friday and dinner menu has starters , meat and fish menu.

 I want to give the customers with good experience for the first visit itself.The website also included images  for 
 the menu items  and restaurant and bar image .
